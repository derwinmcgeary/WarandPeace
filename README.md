## What is a word?

There are plenty of definitions, but for this program now a word is Latin
alphabet characters surrounded by non-alphabet characters. This captures most
of what is in the text, but has certain problems as (for example) in English
the apostrophe is used in words like "he'll" and the program would count "he" and "ll" as separate words.
